While writing rules for these chatbots, it is important to expect all possible user inputs, else the bot may fail to answer properly. Hence, rule-based chatbots do not possess any cognitive skills.<a href=\"#These-bots-respond-to-users&#39;-inputs-based-on-certain-pre-specified-rules.-For-instance,-these-rules-can-be-defined-as-if-elif-else-statements.-While-writing-rules-for-these-chatbots,-it-is-important-to-expect-all-possible-user-inputs,-else-the-bot-may-fail-to-answer-properly.-Hence,-rule-based-chatbots-do-not-possess-any-cognitive-skills.\" class=\"anchor-link\">¶</a>\n",

    "> ##### This article describes building an intelligent AI chatbot based on the famous transformer architecture - Microsoft's DialoGPT. According to [Hugging Face's model card](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium), DialoGPT is a State-Of-The-Art large-scale pretrained dialogue response generation model for multiturn conversations. The human evaluation results indicate that the response generated from DialoGPT is comparable to human response quality under a single-turn conversation Turing test. The model is trained on 147M multi-turn dialogue from Reddit discussion thread.<a href=\"#This-article-describes-building-an-intelligent-AI-chatbot-based-on-the-famous-transformer-architecture---Microsoft&#39;s-DialoGPT.-According-to-Hugging-Face&#39;s-model-card,-DialoGPT-is-a-State-Of-The-Art-large-scale-pretrained-dialogue-response-generation-model-for-multiturn-conversations.-The-human-evaluation-results-indicate-that-the-response-generated-from-DialoGPT-is-comparable-to-human-response-quality-under-a-single-turn-conversation-Turing-test.-The-model-is-trained-on-147M-multi-turn-dialogue-from-Reddit-discussion-thread.\" class=\"anchor-link\">¶</a>\n",
